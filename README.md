# CSS 3d Legos

Creates 3d Lego blocks with HTML and CSS


**WARNING** this is really slow, because most browsers can't handle rendering so many layers. It's basically just a proof of concept, but probably can't actually be used anywhere. For something more interesting, check out the [webgl version](https://github.com/lakenen/webgl-3d-lego).

## Build

To build this, first install browserify:

```
npm i -g browserify
```

Then to build, run this:

```
browserify index.js -o bundle.js
```
